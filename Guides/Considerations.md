# Cosiderations and Starting steps

1. Rather than coding out an aplication to scrape convertions rates and store them, rather use an existing API
2. Where to find the API and how must we vet them?
3. Googling results in nuerous options... *Did any work*
4. Alternatively, as we can use a hub for API and try to source a free varient, go to [rapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub)
   <br>-**Make note of what makes rapid API as a Host and hub unique**<br>
6. Try serching for an respective API here, again we run into similar issues
7. Lets apply a filter -> Drop down Colleections and select Free Public APIs for Developers
8. The one used in the Activity is [Currency Exchange](https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange/)
9. Review the Hub page. The end points, code snippets and apply to your MVC API.
10. Sign up and get your Key/ Host
11. Now onto the code
